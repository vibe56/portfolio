🚀 Developer Portfolio Website – Installation & Deployment Guide 

This guide will help you install, run, and deploy the portfolio website built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
 It is designed to be beginner-friendly and comes with comments in the code so you can easily understand what each part does and customize it as you like.

🔹 1. Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:
Node.js (v18 or later) → Download here


npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn as your package manager


A code editor (recommended: Visual Studio Code)


Basic understanding of Git (optional but useful)



🔹 2. Running the Portfolio Locally
Step 1: Download the Project
Download the source code (ZIP file) from the package you received.


Extract the ZIP file into a folder on your computer.
 Example: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\portfolio


Step 2: Open in VS Code
Open Visual Studio Code (or any editor you use).


Click File → Open Folder → select the extracted folder.


Step 3: Install Dependencies
Open a terminal inside VS Code and run:
npm install

This will install all the required node modules.
Step 4: Run the Development Server
Start the local development server with:
npm run dev

You’ll see a message like:
 Local: http://localhost:5173/


Open that link in your browser → 🎉 Your portfolio is live locally!



🔹 3. Customizing the Portfolio
The project is written in React + Tailwind + Framer Motion and has comments in every file to explain what’s happening.
You can easily customize:
Personal details → Change your name, bio, and skills in the About component.


Projects → Update Projects.jsx with your own work and links.


Colors & Fonts → Modify index.css for theme customization.


Animations → Controlled with Framer Motion (already explained in comments).


👉 Every section in the code is commented, so you’ll know exactly what to edit.

🔹 4. Deploying the Portfolio (Free Hosting)
You can make your portfolio live on the internet for free using Vercel or Netlify.
✅ Option A: Deploy on Vercel
Go to https://vercel.com and sign up with GitHub/Google.


Click “New Project” → Import your portfolio project from GitHub.


(If you don’t use GitHub, you can upload the project directly.)


Vercel will auto-detect Vite + React and set everything up.


Click Deploy → Wait for a minute → Your portfolio is live at:
 https://your-portfolio.vercel.app



✅ Option B: Deploy on Netlify
Go to https://netlify.com and sign up.

🔹 5. Using a Custom Professional Domain
If you want a professional domain like yourname.com:
Step 1: Buy a Domain
Purchase from Namecheap, GoDaddy, Hostinger, Google Domains, etc.


Step 2: Connect to Hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
Go to your hosting dashboard (Vercel or Netlify).


Find Domain Settings → Add Custom Domain.


Enter your domain (e.g., yourname.com).


Update DNS settings from your domain provider (Vercel/Netlify will give you records to add).


👉 Within a few hours, your portfolio will be live at your custom domain.
